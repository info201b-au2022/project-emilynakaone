## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 
## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Chart 1

```{r chart 1, echo=FALSE}
boxplot_chart
```

This chart is a box plot showing the distribution trends of the water temperature at the ocean floor. Each observation for ocean floor temperature is recorded each time there was a fishing haul for snow crabs during the fishing season. It can be seen that there is an overall increase of temperature as the year of fishing seasons become more recent. It has been recorded that there has been a drastic increase of temperature between 2021 and 2022, the data only shows fishing hauls up to 2018. However it can be seen that there is a steady increase even dating back to 2012 as the median temperature increases each year. This can have a negative impact on the snow crab populations as temperature increase can lead to disease, oxygen loss, and reduced biodiversity within the ecosystem.
