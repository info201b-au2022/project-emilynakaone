## Abstract:

Our main question is why the snow crab population has declined significantly in the past year. This question is important because it disrupts the ecosystem and could indicate global climate change. To address the question, we plan to analyze data relating to ocean conditions and how that relates to population numbers of specific crab species.

## Expected Implications:

If we are to accurately determine that the change of climate and ocean temperature has an effect on ocean species populations, this would create further evidence that policy makers need to create more impactful policies on climate change. With a large global population relying on marine life for income and as a food source, it is important to aid in marine conservation, regardless of the reason why species populations are declining. The declining population evidence can also be a sign of overfishing of snow crabs. With the fishing season of crabs being closed this year and possibly next year, it may result in policies changing where the total amount of fishing may reduce for years to come. This would be done through policy changes made by the department of wildlife in order to save species from extinction. Also, with this drastic decline of a species that has never been seen on this scale, technologists and scientists may increase the variety of data recorded around marine species to gain an overall better understanding of how ecosystems are affected by external factors such as climate change.

## Limitations:

One limitation of the research questions is the amount of data that can be connected. For example, we want to find the correlation between temperature and population. However, there can be other influences that can affect the overall health of snow crabs, such as oxygen saturation, and acidification of the water that would be harder to record reliably. Another limitation to consider is the possibility of a bias being formed when collecting data. With this type of research question, a declining species population could easily be connected to climate change. This means it is important to analyze data without any bias as it is entirely possible that there could be some other connection to why the population is declining. This is why it is important to look at the context of all the data, and avoid any cherry picked data used to push a certain narrative through data visualization.
