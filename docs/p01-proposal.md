## Abstract:

Our main question is why the snow crab population has declined significantly in the past year. This question is important because it disrupts the ecosystem and could indicate global climate change. To address the question, we plan to analyze data relating to ocean conditions and how that relates to population numbers of specific crab species.

## Introduction

Over the past year the population of snow crabs has declined by close to 80%, causing many locations to end crab season prematurely. This sudden decline in snow crabs that reside mainly off the coast in Alaska in the Bering, Beaufort, and Chukchi sea have raised alarms for possible bigger problems. The decline has caused many problems in several populations from fishers to consumers to other marine life, and without intervention it could continue to cause many more issues. Many scientists are confused as to why this is happening and believe that there may be a correlation between climate change and the effect it has on certain ocean species populations. We plan to analyze the correlation between crab populations, sea floor temperatures, fishing haul numbers, and location to better understand the issue and possible solutions to alleviate it.

## Problem Domain

The sharp decline in the crab population has indicated to scientists that the effects of climate change may be more severe than previously imagined. While we deal with problems from overfishing, research shows the decline in the crab population is not related to that and shows it could be a precursor to a broader issue relating to climate change. Previous research has shown that crustaceans, which include crabs, are hit first by ocean acidification because the increase in CO2 levels present affects their ability to form hard skeletons and shells which protect them from predators and the harsh ocean environment. With the rapid, continuous increase of water levels and decrease in pH levels of the ocean, many species will be affected by the drastic changes in the ecosystem and habitat. A potential direct stakeholder to this issue is the ecosystem in which the snow crabs live in and the species that interact with them. With a sudden decline in the snow crab population, species that consumed or were consumed by snow crabs are no longer kept under control creating a disrupted ecosystem and food chain. Populations that were once kept constant due to being consumed now experience a sudden rise in population size causing them to deplete their food source quicker. This creates a chain reaction down the food chain eventually leading to a collapsed ecosystem. An indirect stakeholder to the snow crab population decline could be human consumers and fishers who rely on snow crabs as their source of food and income. With such a drastic change in population, crabbers are not able to keep up with consumer demands, resulting in an unstable source of income. Species such as halibut and squid that consume and rely on snow crabs would also likely see a decrease in their population, leading to a decrease in their fishing and consumption as well. Over three billion people rely on seafood to provide vital nutrients to their diet and with such a decline, it will create difficulty for certain populations to attain the same level of nutrients they once had. To protect fishermen from losing their source of income and consumers from losing their source of nutrients it is important to target the root of the problem in addition to the decline of the crab population.

## The Data Set

The data set we will be utilizing in this project includes Geospatial Data about Alaskan Snow Crabs in the Eastern Bering Sea. The data was collected between 1975 to 2018. Scientists began noticing the snow crab population decline around 2018, so by analyzing the trends in data up until the start of the decline, we will be able to ascertain if any geospatial features contributed to this species' loss. We will be focusing on data collected on location, bottom depth, sea temperature, bottom temperature, and haul size. Ocean acidification has been a recent issue that has caused lots of habitat damage and species loss. By looking at the temperature data, we will be able to see if the crabs have been affected by ocean acidification or by other factors in the changing ocean ecosystem. Other factors could include sea temperatures rising, or sea levels rising. We will be able to analyze these factors through the data included in this data set. Bottom depth can link to rising sea levels and the temperature data will show us how temperatures have been fluctuating over the years. This data was collected and cleaned up by The Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC). They began the collection of data on December 31st, 1974, and last updated it on December 30th, 2018. The data were collected to evaluate the temporal distribution and abundance of the commercially important snow crab. This data collection was funded by the NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a government-funded agency, so the data is reputable. The data were collected to estimate population abundance and biomass for these commercially abundant species. NOAA performed bottom trawl surveys to monitor crab stocks. This was important because the distribution and abundance of the crabs impact the ecosystem and commercial success of the crabs and other marine products. Fishermen and ocean preservationists are benefited from this data since they can monitor crab populations and check how much they should be able to catch each year and how to preserve the populations. The data was held secure by the government and was continuously updated by NOAA as they collected data. Now the dataset is publicly available to use on Kaggle since data collection has finished.

## Expected Implications:

If we are to accurately determine that the change of climate and ocean temperature has an effect on ocean species populations, this would create further evidence that policy makers need to create more impactful policies on climate change. With a large global population relying on marine life for income and as a food source, it is important to aid in marine conservation, regardless of the reason why species populations are declining. The declining population evidence can also be a sign of overfishing of snow crabs. With the fishing season of crabs being closed this year and possibly next year, it may result in policies changing where the total amount of fishing may reduce for years to come. This would be done through policy changes made by the department of wildlife in order to save species from extinction. Also, with this drastic decline of a species that has never been seen on this scale, technologists and scientists may increase the variety of data recorded around marine species to gain an overall better understanding of how ecosystems are affected by external factors such as climate change.

## Limitations:

One limitation of the research questions is the amount of data that can be connected. For example, we want to find the correlation between temperature and population. However, there can be other influences that can affect the overall health of snow crabs, such as oxygen saturation, and acidification of the water that would be harder to record reliably. Another limitation to consider is the possibility of a bias being formed when collecting data. With this type of research question, a declining species population could easily be connected to climate change. This means it is important to analyze data without any bias as it is entirely possible that there could be some other connection to why the population is declining. This is why it is important to look at the context of all the data, and avoid any cherry picked data used to push a certain narrative through data visualization.
